I have just met Sirs Bertha, Gelbero and Bethany! "Sir Bertha, Sir Gelbero, Sir  Bethany or Sir Edna is a Knight," whispered Sir Bethany. I asked Sir Gelbero who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Bertha, Sir Gelbero, Sir Bethany, Sir Edna and Sir Ronald are Knaves." Then I met Sir Bethany who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Bertha, Sir Gelbero, Sir Bethany, Sir Edna, Sir Ronald or Sir Lisa is a Knave."
