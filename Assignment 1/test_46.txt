I have just met Sirs Shawn, Wesley, Emily and Teresa. Then I met Sir Shawn who introduced me to his friend and told me: "exactly one of Sir Shawn, Sir Wesley, Sir Emily and Sir Teresa is a Knave." I asked Sir Wesley who he was, and he answered impatiently: "at least one of Sir Shawn, Sir Wesley, Sir Emily and Sir Teresa is a Knight!" "Exactly one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Teresa. "At most one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Emily. "Exactly one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Emily. Then I met Sir Vernon who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of Sir Shawn, Sir Wesley, Sir Emily, Sir Teresa, Sir Jo, Sir Jennifer, Sir Jamie and Sir Vernon is a Knave!"
