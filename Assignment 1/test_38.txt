I have just seen Sirs Hilda and Cecil! I asked Sir Hilda who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Hilda and Sir Cecil are Knights." Then I met Sir Deanna who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knave." Sir Hilda said: "exactly one of Sir Hilda, Sir Cecil, Sir Deanna, Sir Willard, Sir Terry, Sir Billy and Sir Mark is a Knight." Then I met Sir Willard who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knave." Sir Jon said: "all of us are Knights."
