I have just met Sir Georgia. Then I met Sir Georgia who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of us is a Knight!" "Sir Georgia, Sir Irma and Sir Vivian are Knights," whispered Sir Georgia. Sir Cecil said: "exactly one of Sir Georgia, Sir Irma, Sir Vivian, Sir Cecil and Sir Antonio is a Knight." Sir Antonio said: "Sir Georgia, Sir Irma, Sir Vivian, Sir Cecil, Sir Antonio or Sir Johnson is a Knave."
