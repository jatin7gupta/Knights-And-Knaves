I have just met Sir Raul. "At most one of Sir Raul and Sir Bruce is a Knight," whispered Sir Raul. I asked Sir Maurice who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Laura is a Knight!" I asked Sir Chris who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Raul,Sir Bruce,Sir Maurice, Sir Laura or Sir Chris is a Knight."
