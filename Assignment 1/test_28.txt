I have just seen Sirs Marion and Lily! Sir Marion said: "at most one of Sir Marion, Sir Lily and Sir Jim is a Knight." "Exactly one of Sir Marion, Sir Lily and Sir Jim is a Knave," whispered Sir Marion. "All of us are Knights," whispered Sir Madison. I asked Sir Jim who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Marion, Sir Lily, Sir Jim, Sir Madison or Sir Guy is a Knave." Sir Linda said: "I am a Knave."
