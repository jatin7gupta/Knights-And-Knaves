I have just met Sirs Jimmy, June and Ray. "At most one of Sir Jimmy, Sir June, Sir Ray and Sir Vivian is a Knight," whispered Sir Vivian. Then I met Sir Vivian who introduced me to his friend and told me: "I am a Knight." I asked Sir Julia who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Jimmy, Sir June, Sir Ray, Sir Vivian, Sir Priscilla, Sir Dean, Sir Julia, Sir Anthony and Sir Kenneth are Knaves."
