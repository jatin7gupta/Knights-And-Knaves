I have just seen Sirs Elmer and April! "Exactly one of Sir Elmer, Sir April and Sir Damian is a Knave," whispered Sir April. "Sir Elmer, Sir April, Sir Damian and Sir Walter are Knaves," whispered Sir Damian. Then I met Sir Gordon who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Elmer, Sir April, Sir Damian, Sir Walter, Sir Christopher or Sir Gordon is a Knave." Sir Walter said: "at least one of us is a Knave!"
