I have just met Sir Michael. Then I met Sir Michael who introduced me to his friend and told me: "at least one of Sir Michael and Sir Brad is a Knight!" "At least one of us is a Knave," whispered Sir Marsha. Then I met Sir David who introduced me to his friend and told me: "Sir Michael, Sir Brad, Sir Erin, Sir Marsha, Sir David or Sir Pamela is a Knight." "Sir Wade is a Knight," whispered Sir David.
